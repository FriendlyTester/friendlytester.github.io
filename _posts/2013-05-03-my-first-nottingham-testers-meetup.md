So last night we had the rebirth of the Nottingham Tester Meetup, and it was fantastic, but lets start at the beginning.  

I will be honest, at 6.55 there was 3 people including me in the room, and it was hard to not feel a little deflated / disappointed, but I learnt a valuable lesson:  

> QUALITY/PASSION > QUANTITY

But by 7.30, we had a room containing 5 passionate testers and 1 passionate recruiter (he counts, as he doesn't work like your normal recruiter, but off course still a recruiter :D ) and the discussions began.

Was great talking to everyone, finding what they work on, what they roles are, how many in their teams, what tools are they using, well you get the point.

I had prepared some slides, which I went through and we discussed in slide, the end result was some great enthusiasm for this meetup, and I really can't wait for the next one.

The slides are here, nothing fancy, just my ideas and plans for Nottingham Testers Meetup.

They were spawned from this [mind map](http://www.mindmup.com/m#m:a1d244205096070130bac132ea3747e85a). Side note, mindmup is a great tool.  

So thank you Stephen, Dan, Alex, James, Dave and Vernon for coming.

The next one will be arranged soon, and will consist of two talks, details next week, however I want to leave testers of East Midlands with the following warning:  

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for dull passion lacking testers, I can tell you we don't have any. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a medium length career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you register interest in my meetup below, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and you will join my meetup.
