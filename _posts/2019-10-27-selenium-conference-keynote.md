Seven years after attending my first conference, I just keynoted at that conference.

In 2012 I attended my first ever software testing conference, Selenium Conference, London. It was the start of an epic journey for me. Prior to discovering that conference I didn't even know folk got together to talk about testing. Seven years on and I've been involved in over [85 events](/events), as a speaker, instructor, keynoter and organiser.

At the start of this month I had the privilege of keynoting at Selenium Conference, my keynote was titled 'Redefining Test Automation'. This talk has been seven years in the making and it was so fitting to deliver a new version of this talk at Selenium Conference, where it all started.

The talk was recorded and added to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIDvGzQdoxc), love to hear your thoughts on the talk.
