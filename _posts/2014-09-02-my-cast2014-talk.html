So I had the privilege or talking at CAST this year, along with that came the option of talking on the live stream. Wasn't 100% sold at first, but then thought, you know what, lets go for it.<br /><br />It was great being on the live stream and having the interaction with viewers via twitter during the open season and post talk. Also allowed me to host a #NottsTest where the attendees watched me live at my own meetup, that's cool!<br /><br />But the benefits for you reading this is that, talks which were on the live stream were also recorded. So here it is, catchy title, but worth a watch even if I do say so my self.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CINKp_CFcA0" style="text-align: center;" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />I will do a detailed write up about my talk, as an article for a publication soon...
