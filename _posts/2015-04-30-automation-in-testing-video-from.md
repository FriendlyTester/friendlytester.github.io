In March I had the privilege of talking at [TestBash](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/training-events/testbash-2015/). My talk was title "Automation In Testing". The talk is my experience with automation throughout my career and I how I feel current terminology restricts peoples views and usage of Automation, such as Test Automation.  

Anyhow, the talk was recorded and is available on the Ministry of Testing Dojo, you will need to sign up, however its free to do so.  

Enjoy, and I appreciate all feedback on content, presentation style or anything else you feel I may be interested in.
