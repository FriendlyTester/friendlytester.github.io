<br />So I have been using a page object (PO) approach for a while now, but not been blogging for long, so am going to mark the below as "My Page Object Mach 1", and will continue the theme as my PO's involve.<br /><br />So to start with I have abstract class which we are going to call DefaultPage, this is essentially my default PO, but it started by just handling WebDriver, like so:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/FriendlyTester/6982176.js"></script><br />It has since evolved into having several methods for interactions I found myself repeating, such as populated and reading fields, and dealing with Select boxes.<br /><br />Then each of my page objects inherits the DefaultPage.<br /><br />The basic structure of my page objects is:<br /><ul><li>Initiate locators.</li><li>Wait for a specific element</li><li>Assert that the application has taken you to the correct page, using a specific attribute of an element or could use the URL depending on your application.</li></ul><div><span style="color: red;">Edit: I no longer agree with Assertions in PageObjects. The PageObjects job/role is to allow a test/check to interact with a page, a test/check would soon tell you there is an issue when the PO fails to serve the request. And if you are always running all your tests/checks, which you should be otherwise why bother to create them, you know soon enough if the page header isn't correct!</span></div><div><br /></div>Which looks like:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/FriendlyTester/6982183.js"></script><br /><br />I parameterise the timeout value, as I required to increase it for specific tests / environments, so made sense to make it default page of my approach.<br /><br />I have heard people not recommend putting asserts in your page objects, however I believe that should be the rule for the methods but serves a good purpose in the constructor.<br /><br />Then objects are instantiated like so:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/FriendlyTester/6982189.js"></script><br /><br />Perhaps for another post, but I believe this is a good approach, and as mentioned above you can add common methods to the default page.<br /><br />Appreciate all comments.
