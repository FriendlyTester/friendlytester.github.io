So I had the privilege or talking at CAST this year, along with that came the option of talking on the live stream. Wasn't 100% sold at first, but then thought, you know what, lets go for it.  

It was great being on the live stream and having the interaction with viewers via twitter during the open season and post talk. Also allowed me to host a #NottsTest where the attendees watched me live at my own meetup, that's cool!  

But the benefits for you reading this is that, talks which were on the live stream were also recorded. So here it is, catchy title, but worth a watch even if I do say so my self.
