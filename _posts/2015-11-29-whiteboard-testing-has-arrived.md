So, a while back whilst researching a testing topic, I was searching YouTube for relevant videos. I found myself in this circle of thinking I had found something, then realising it was awful. Finding something different, but then realising it was an hour long. I was appalled at the quality of testing related videos on YouTube. Only good content I was finding was conference talks, but again, all lengthy.  

So this nagged me for a while, I started thinking, I am sure a lot of people must turn to YouTube like I did, so therefore they are being faced with the same poor videos I was finding. This isn't good for our craft. Especially if people are new or less aware about testing then I am, they make take some of these videos as gospel.  

So I decided to do something about it. I turned to my trusty whiteboard in the office and started scribbling, mapping out some ideas. Then it clicked, what if I recorded some video's in front of this board, using the board as "living" slides, so to speak. I could draw up models and critic them, I can write out key bullets point and add to them during the talk, I could pretty much do anything.  

So there it was, I had created Whiteboard Testing. You can checkout the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QZWhi0ojqNte3ey7RD0qQ) and I also created a twitter account for it [@WhiteboardTest](http://twitter.com/WhiteboardTest). There are currently two videos uploaded, one is about my plans for the channel, and the second is about a model I drew in relation to Regression Testing, the FART model. You can find them by clicking on the channel page.  

I explain this in the introduction to the Whiteboard Testing video, but I want to repeat it. This channel is not for me, it's not about me. The goal for the channel, is to fill it will short and relevant information on Testing. I am talking videos that are 5-10 minutes long (yes I know, the regression one was 12 minutes, I will get better :D). But, I can not do this alone, I need the help of the wider community.  

So if you have the following, which I'm sure you all do, consider creating a video, send it to me, and will can look at getting it on the Whiteboard Testing channel.  

*   A whiteboard, flip chart or that sticky stuff you put on the wall.
*   A video camera or a smartphone.
*   A tripod, or a friend to hold the camera. 
*   Something to talk about.

These videos are not high production, look at the intro video to work that out. I'm not looking for fantastic visual effects, I'm looking for awesome content, that is going to help drive our craft forward.

So please do help me share awareness about [Whiteboard Testing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QZWhi0ojqNte3ey7RD0qQ), and I looked forward to seeing some of your videos on there in the future.  

You can watch the intro video here.
