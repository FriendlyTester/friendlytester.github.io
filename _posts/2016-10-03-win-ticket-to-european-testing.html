So, the folks at <a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/2017/">European Testing Conference 2017</a> are awesome, because they share the profits with the people who play a large part in making the event happen, the speakers. So this year I did a workshop and a talk, therefore I earned free conference ticket for the 2017 event in Helsinki, or the money, I opted for the ticket.<br /><br />I'm taking a sabbatical next year, and therefore unable to use this ticket, so I'm going to give it away!<br /><br />So the conference is taking place in Helsinki on the 9th-10th February 2017. This competition is for the ticket <b><span style="color: red;">ONLY</span></b>, I'm not offering travel and accommodation.<br /><br />So, how do you enter, and importantly give yourself a chance to win?<br /><br />Well, I started a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QZWhi0ojqNte3ey7RD0qQ">Whiteboard Testing</a>, the purpose of the channel is to offer short informative videos on testing, no longer than 10 minutes. So to enter, I want you to create a video for the YouTube channel.<br /><br />The rules:-<br /><br /><ul><li>This can be on any topic you believe relates to testing</li><li>IMPORTANT, please don't mention that this is for the competition during the video</li><li>You do not need to use a whiteboard specifically, it could be a piece of paper stuck on a wall or a chalkboard, but there should be some visualisation to support the talk</li><li>Submit your video to me at richard&lt;donotincludethisbitinmyemailaddress&gt;bradshaw@gmail.com along with a title and description of the video for YouTube</li><li>I suggest you watch some of the existing videos to get an idea of the pattern</li><li>You can enter as many different videos as you wish</li></ul><div><b><span style="color: red;"><br /></span></b><b><span style="color: red;">The competition ends on the 31st October 2016</span></b></div><div><br /></div><div>I will then form a team of testing excellence to determine which we believe is the best video, and they win the ticket!!! Simples.&nbsp;</div>
