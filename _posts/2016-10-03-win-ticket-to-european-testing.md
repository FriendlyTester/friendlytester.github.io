So, the folks at [European Testing Conference 2017](http://europeantestingconference.eu/2017/) are awesome, because they share the profits with the people who play a large part in making the event happen, the speakers. So this year I did a workshop and a talk, therefore I earned free conference ticket for the 2017 event in Helsinki, or the money, I opted for the ticket.  

I'm taking a sabbatical next year, and therefore unable to use this ticket, so I'm going to give it away!  

So the conference is taking place in Helsinki on the 9th-10th February 2017\. This competition is for the ticket **<span style="color: red;">ONLY</span>**, I'm not offering travel and accommodation.  

So, how do you enter, and importantly give yourself a chance to win?  

Well, I started a YouTube channel called [Whiteboard Testing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QZWhi0ojqNte3ey7RD0qQ), the purpose of the channel is to offer short informative videos on testing, no longer than 10 minutes. So to enter, I want you to create a video for the YouTube channel.  

The rules:-  
*   This can be on any topic you believe relates to testing
*   IMPORTANT, please don't mention that this is for the competition during the video
*   You do not need to use a whiteboard specifically, it could be a piece of paper stuck on a wall or a chalkboard, but there should be some visualisation to support the talk
*   Submit your video to me at richard<donotincludethisbitinmyemailaddress>bradshaw@gmail.com along with a title and description of the video for YouTube
*   I suggest you watch some of the existing videos to get an idea of the pattern
*   You can enter as many different videos as you wish

<span style="color: red;">The competition ends on the 31st October 2016</span>

I will then form a team of testing excellence to determine which we believe is the best video, and they win the ticket!!!  
Simples.
