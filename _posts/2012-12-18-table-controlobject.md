So in a previous <a href="http://www.thefriendlytester.co.uk/2012/11/i-call-them-controlobjects.html">post</a>&nbsp;I mentioned that I create objects which I call ControlObjects and a few of you told me that you do too and some of you call them Elements.<br /><br />Would like to thank Adam Goucher for including it on a "Smattering of Selenium".<br /><br />So I mentioned I would share a some of them, so here is the first, its a Table ControlObject. My companies application has a financial section, with extended use of dynamic tables, so those lead to this object.<br /><br />Before I created this object I found myself using a lot of XPath to read data from the table, and as we all know its not the most robust method for&nbsp;retrieving&nbsp;elements, however when you have a table, its hard to interact with a specific row/column unless it has a unique identifier which is rare.<br /><br />So, I thought what if I can add some logic to my XPath calls, so that I was confident I was getting the cell I wanted.<br />A well structured HTML table consists of &lt;table&gt;/&lt;thead&gt;&lt;/th&gt; for the table headers and &lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; for the row and cells structure, so a standard XPath call would read: "<span style="color: red;">table/tbody/tr[4]/td[3]</span>" with the numbers being the required row / cell.<br /><br />So what if I could determine those numbers using information I knew, then I could be assured I was always getting the cell I wanted, so here is how I&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;it.<br /><br />I created a new object which took a table element as its parameter, then I create two lists, one for the headers (th) and one for the rows (tr), using By.Tagname, this then allows to me to inspect these lists for information I know, which in turn I can use to create an XPath request to retrieve the required cell / row.<br /><br />So the standard structure of our tables is column headers&nbsp;across&nbsp;the top and the first column being a unique value such as a cost code / Id.<br /><br />So I know the name of the unique column is "Cost Code", I can then iterate through my column headers list to find the IWebElement text that equals "Cost Code", I can then get the index of that element in the list, +1 (this is important as Lists are 0 indexed, Xpath isn't) which gives me the correct td[x] value.<br /><br />Then I can loop through the row list, using XPath to find the row that matches my unique value. So lets say that returned as 1.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/FriendlyTester/6982078.js"></script><br />Then from that match, I can do the same again to get the index of the column I want to read from, so lets say thats 5, then use XPath again to return the cell I was looking for.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/FriendlyTester/6982113.js"></script><br />So XPath can be useful especially if used Dynamically.<br /><br />To note this will work if the table doesn't have a thead area, however the first row which would contain all the th tags would be counted and looped through when looking for rows.<br /><br />I have added the project to my <a href="https://github.com/FriendlyTester">GitHub account</a> so please do download and have a look, and hopefully will be useful to some of you.<br /><br />The project contains the ControlObject along with a set of tests to show it working. The tests are NUnit tests and use FirefoxDriver, and use the table below.<br /><br /><table id="customers"><thead><tr><th>Company</th>           <th>Contact</th>           <th>Country</th>         </tr></thead>       <tbody><tr>           <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>           <td>Maria Anders</td>           <td>Germany</td>         </tr><tr class="alt">           <td>Berglunds snabbköp</td>           <td>Christina Berglund</td>           <td>Sweden</td>         </tr><tr>           <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>           <td>Francisco Chang</td>           <td>Mexico</td>         </tr><tr class="alt">           <td>Ernst Handel</td>           <td>Roland Mendel</td>           <td>Austria</td>         </tr><tr>           <td>Island Trading</td>           <td>Helen Bennett</td>           <td>UK</td>         </tr><tr class="alt">           <td>Königlich Essen</td>           <td>Philip Cramer</td>           <td>Germany</td>         </tr><tr>           <td>Laughing Bacchus Winecellars</td>           <td>Yoshi Tannamuri</td>           <td>Canada</td>         </tr><tr class="alt">           <td>Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti</td>           <td>Giovanni Rovelli</td>           <td>Italy</td>         </tr><tr>           <td>North/South</td>           <td>Simon Crowther</td>           <td>UK</td>         </tr><tr class="alt">           <td>Paris spécialités</td>           <td>Marie Bertrand</td>           <td>France</td>         </tr><tr>           <td>The Big Cheese</td>           <td>Liz Nixon</td>           <td>USA</td>         </tr><tr class="alt">           <td>Vaffeljernet</td>           <td>Palle Ibsen</td>           <td>Denmark</td>         </tr></tbody>     </table>
