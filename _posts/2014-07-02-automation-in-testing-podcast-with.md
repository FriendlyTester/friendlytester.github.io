A few moths back Mark Tomlinson approached me, asking if I was interested in recording a podcast. At first I was very much leading towards no, the thought of impromptu discussion did scare me.  

However, even further back then this request I had a Skype conversion with Michael Bolton regarding my fear or upcoming talks. Was a lengthy conversation, but the outcome was simply, these things are a great learning curve, of course you will be nervous and not everyone will agree with what you have to say. Just do you best, put the work in, and be prepared for questions, but most important; enjoy it and learn from it.  

So here is the result of the approach from Mark, a podcast where we discuss lots of things, which I titled "Automation in Testing".  

Enjoy, appreciate all feedback.
