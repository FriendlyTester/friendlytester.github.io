> **Share** _A part of a larger amount that is divided among a number of people, or to which a number of people contribute._

I want to start my blog by thanking everyone out there that already blogs and tweets about testing, for sharing their knowledge and experiences. 

So far in my testing career I've been taking all your parts and processing them to further my skills and progress my career, so again thank you all for sharing.

However, in the last few years my skillset has developed hugely and I feel that I am now in a position to contribute by sharing my knowledge and experiences.

It actually excites me that I too could write something that will further the skills of new testers or even established testers.

So please do follow me on twitter [@FriendlyTester](https://twitter.com/FriendlyTester)Â and check back to see if I share anything that interests you.
