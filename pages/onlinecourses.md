I currently have three courses available on this site, all free. Those are Programming Basics, Java Basics (incs IntelliJ and JUnit) and Selenium WebDriver in Java. I'm also working on numerous video courses that will be available on the [Ministry of Testing Dojo](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com){:target="_blank"}.

In August 2017 I decided to make my Introduction to Selenium WebDriver course available online, for **free**. In doing so, I also created two additional free courses on Programming and Java Basics, to assist people with the Selenium one.

I hope you find these courses useful, they are by no means exhaustive, but I hope valuable. I'd love to hear from you if this material helps you with your testing journey.

All the courses below are text and code based. No videos.

### Programming Basics
Not sure if it's right to call this a course, perhaps more a collection of guides and useful material in a structured order.  
This course will introduce you to the basic concepts and terminology associated with programming.

### Java Basics
If you're new to Java and Programming I suggest you complete the 'Programming Basics' first, before tackling this one.

This course covers the basics of Java and is designed as a prerequisite for my Selenium WebDriver course.  
It will hopefully teach you the basics of Java to aid your understanding of testing frameworks like Selenium WebDriver.

I common pattern I'm seeing in the industry is people diving straight into learning an automation framework. Don't do this.

I strongly encourage you to get familiar with programming terminology and concepts. Then pick a language and get familiar with that. Then more to the frameworks.  
Such a journey will hugely assist you with your automation journey, especially when you run into difficulties with the frameworks.

### Selenium WebDriver in Java
The same pattern applies as above. If you're looking to learn Selenium WebDriver and have no programming experience, I encourage you to complete the two above courses first.

This is a free online version of my face to face workshop [Getting Started With Selenium WebDriver](/training/getting-started-with-selenium-webdriver/).  
This course is designed to teach you all the basics you need to get started with Selenium WebDriver as well as snippets of my wisdom from using Selenium for 10 years.

I hope to add more courses in the future, both free and on the [Ministry of Testing Dojo](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com){:target="_blank"}, so if you don't already, follow me on social media or connect on LinkedIn to hear about them first.

Also if any of these courses or pages proved valuable to you, consider sharing them with friends and colleagues.

Thanks.
