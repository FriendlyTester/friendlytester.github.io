There is currently no more, sad face I know!

* Run window in IntelliJ
* Categories in JUnit

As and when I think about things to add to this, I add them to my personal backlog.  
If there is something specific you'd like to see on my roadmap for Basic Java please leave a comment below.

Or if you have any feedback, good or bad, please leave a comment.
