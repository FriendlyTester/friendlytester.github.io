There is currently no more, a sad face I know!  

If you got some value from this class, and are willing, can you add a comment below as an endorsement?

### Roadmap
* Run window in IntelliJ
* Categories in JUnit
* Expand more about Primitive and Ojbects in Java. Specifically Int and Integer. Suggested by Vikram

As and when I think about things to add to this, I add them to my personal backlog.  
If there is something specific you'd like to see on my roadmap for Basic Java please leave a comment below.

Or if you have any feedback, good or bad, please leave a comment.
