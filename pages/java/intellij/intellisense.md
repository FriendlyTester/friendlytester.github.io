It's awesome! It means you don't need to remember all the methods on an object. It makes exploring new frameworks very easy. It also means you don't have to press all.the.keys().

### Code Completion
IntelliJ will try to guess what it thinks you're about to type. So if you go to a new class, and type pub, intelliJ will offer you 'public', and you can just press type and it will complete pub to public.

### Methods On An Object
When we are playing with a new framework, or perhaps another member of the team has created a class for us, we want to explore what methods we have. IntelliSense makes this very easy. We create a new instance of the object, and simple press '.' and IntelliJ will present us with all the methods. Here we can see all the methods available on a WebElement in Selenium WebDriver.
