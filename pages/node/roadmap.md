There is currently no more, a sad face I know!  

If you got some value from this class, and are willing, can you add a comment the [course list](/training/online) page as an endorsement?

### Roadmap
* Update to / or add in ECMAScript 2015 examples
* Details on how to run Mocha inside VSCode

As and when I think about things to add to this, I add them to my personal backlog.  
If there is something specific you'd like to see on my roadmap for Basic Node please leave a comment below.

Or if you have any feedback, good or bad, please leave a comment.
