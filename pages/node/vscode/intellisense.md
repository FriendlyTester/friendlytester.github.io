It's awesome! It means you don't need to remember all the methods on an object. It makes exploring new frameworks very easy. It also means you don't have to press all.the.keys().

### Code Completion
VSCode will try to guess what it thinks you’re about to type. So if you go to a new file, and type 'fun', VSCode will offer you ‘function’, and you can just press tab and it will complete 'fun' to 'function'.

### Functions On An Object
When we are playing with a new framework, or perhaps another member of the team has created an Object for us, we want to explore what properties we have. IntelliSense makes this very easy. We create a new instance of the object, and simply press '.' and VSCode will present us with all the functions as demonstrated in this handy gif from the [Official VS Code Docs on IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense){:target="_blank"}
