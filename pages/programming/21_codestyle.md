Most companies or open source projects will have some form of a style guide. A set of agreed rules about how to write and structure code within this project. They'll cover naming conventions, spacing, bracket placement, max characters on a line, the list is endless. I've linked to some established examples above.

The most common part of a style guide is around naming conventions. That being how we should name parts of our code. For example classes should always be CamelCase, and properties should always be UPPERCASE. In a lot of programming languages they don't actually care what casing you use, so these rules tend to be based on personal preferences and making code more readable.

For someone new to programming, you can get to grips with these at a later date or adopt an established one from the off, I don't really have a fixed approach, but I do encourage everyone to just be consistent with your approach, this will help you understand your own code as you're learning.
