They are as they sound, comments on code. Or more importantly, comments in code. Code comments are a syntax that allows you to write plain english (or your language) within your code.

These are incredibly useful for explaining to others what your code does, or what you hope it does. So as you'll see in my [Java Course](/java/course), I've used code comments extensively to explain what each line does.

On the flip side of this, a lot of developers believe code comments are a sign of bad code. If the code isn't readable, no comments will save it, is the view some people take. 

That aside though, it's important to know the option is there to add comments.

Some use them for humour, here are some good ones from this awesome thread on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/184618/what-is-the-best-comment-in-source-code-you-have-ever-encountered).

```Java
// 
// Dear maintainer:
// 
// Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
// and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
// please increment the following counter as a warning
// to the next guy:
// 
// total_hours_wasted_here = 42
// 

// I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, Darlene, who will 
// have to support me and our three children and the dog once it gets 
// released into the public.

// drunk, will fix later
```
