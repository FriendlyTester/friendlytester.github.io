Version control is a must. Version control is software that keeps tracks of the files in your solution and tracks changes you make to them. It then allows you to save files while maintaining older versions of each file. I true life saver is you accidentally make a breaking change to your solution. You can just rollback. Or a great safety net if you are looking at doing some big changes to your code. 

The most common source control these days is [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial). Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), who also created the Linux kernel! Smart guy. It's adoption was certainly helped by [GitHub](github.com), where is where I store all my public code. GitHub is a hosted version of git. Other are Microsoft TFS, Subversion, Mercurial and CVS.
