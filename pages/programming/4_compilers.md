Compilers are magic! That is all you need to know. I don't understand compilers, the level of my knowledge is that they take my code and compile it into something executable, that can then be run on supporting machines. 

The reason I've included it is for that reason. Most people will write code to run on other machines, could be team members, could be in the cloud. But you'll want to compile your code, so while we don't need to know the internals of them, we have to understand what our code will compile to, and what options that gives us.
