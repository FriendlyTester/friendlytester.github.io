What is programming? In very simple terms it's instructing a computer to perform a task. The computer knows many different commands, we just have to tell it which ones to do and in which order. Simple!

The important bit here though, is *we* tell it commands. For now. AI is growing every day, but I'm sure that will still take a command, 'build this for me' etc. But for now, and for the next 5-15 years, programming will be done by us. So while it's important to learn all the code commands, I'd argue it's more important to understand how to solve problems, and then use code accordingly. How to model applications and to understand the theory over the code. Master the theory, and you can take that to many programming languages. Just learn a language, you'll eventually get left behind.
