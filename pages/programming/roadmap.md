I currently don't have anything else planned for this course. However, I'm going to be creating a video version for [The Dojo](dojo.ministryoftesting.com) over at [Ministry of Testing](ministryoftesting.com), so if you haven't checked out The Dojo, I encourage you to do so.

However, if you feel I've missed something, then please comment below and I'll see if I can get it added.  
Or perhaps you'd like to contribute to this course in some way if so reach out let me know.

If you enjoyed this course and it has provided you with some value, please do let me know on social media or via email, it will break a smile to my face :D
