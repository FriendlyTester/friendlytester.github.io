If you got some value from this class, and are willing, can you add a comment the [course list](/training/online) page as an endorsement?

I currently don't have anything else planned for this course. However, I'm going to be creating a video version for [The Dojo](dojo.ministryoftesting.com) over at [Ministry of Testing](ministryoftesting.com), so if you haven't checked out The Dojo, I encourage you to do so.

However, if you feel I've missed something, then please comment below and I'll see if I can get it added.  
Or perhaps you'd like to contribute to this course in some way if so reach out let me know.
