<p>I provide classes on a whole host of topics related to Software Testing. These are run privately, publicly via <a href="https://ministryoftesting.com?utm_source=friendlytester">Ministry of Testing</a> and at testing events around the world. You can follow my speaking schedule <a href="/events">here</a>.</p>
<p>I offer the following fixed courses, but I'd be happy to tailor something for you if you have specific needs around these topics.</p>
