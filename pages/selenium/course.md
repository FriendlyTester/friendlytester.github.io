Welcome to my free Selenium WebDriver in Java course. I made this course free in August 2017, so that I could focus on other areas related to Automation in Testing, however I didn't want all the years I'd spent mastering Selenium to go to rest, so I made the course freely available.

If you're also new to Java, I encourage you to complete my free Java Basics course before continuing with Selenium WebDriver. 

This is purely a text and code course, I'm going to be creating some supporting videos to this course that will be available on the Ministry of Testing's online learning platform, [**The Dojo**](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com){:target="_blank"}.
