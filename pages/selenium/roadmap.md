There is currently no more, sad face I know!

Here is a list of what I'll be adding in the near future:

* Actions
* Managing windows
* Alerts
* FluentWaits
* Check Element is not present

If there is something specific you'd like to see on my roadmap please leave a comment below.

If you found this course useful, I'd love to hear from you, you can use any of the methods in the footer below, also please share it!
