<p>Whiteboard Testing is a YouTube <a class="bluenumber" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QZWhi0ojqNte3ey7RD0qQ">channel</a> I created dedicated to Software Testing. It consists of short videos, less than 10 minutes, incorporating a visual aid, in most cases a whiteboard. The channel currently has <span class=bluenumber>20</span> videos from <span class=bluenumber>7</span> authors with over <span class=bluenumber>1000</span> subscribers and has had <span class=bluenumber>30,000+</span> views.</p>

<p>I started Whiteboard Testing to get some more informative software testing videos on YouTube. We are not talking, hour long videos, we are talking 5-10minutes to introduce an idea/concept, and those interested enough can reply, comment, video reply or research more for themselves.</p>

<p>Whiteboard Testing is an open channel so if you are interested in posting a video on Whiteboard Testing please contact me (many methods in my footer) with your video, a title and a short description. No fancy production required, as long as they are informative and includes a whiteboard/flipchart to enhance the message, perfect! I'm looking for awesome content, that is going to help drive our craft forward.</p>

<p>Please subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QZWhi0ojqNte3ey7RD0qQ">channel</a> to be informed of the latest videos, or follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/whiteboardtest">@WhiteboardTest</a></p>

<h2>How Whiteboard Testing Was Created</h2>

<p>So, a while back whilst researching a testing topic, I was searching YouTube for relevant videos. I found myself in this circle of thinking I had found something, then realising it was awful. Finding something different, but then realising it was an hour long. I was appalled at the quality of testing related videos on YouTube. Only good content I was finding was conference talks, but again, all lengthy.</p>

<p>So this nagged me for a while, I started thinking, I am sure a lot of people must turn to YouTube like I did, so, therefore, they are being faced with the same poor videos I was finding. This isn't good for our craft. Especially if people are new or less aware about testing then I am, they make take some of these videos as gospel.</p>

<p>So I decided to do something about it. I turned to my trusty whiteboard in the office and started scribbling, mapping out some ideas. Then it clicked, what if I recorded some video's in front of this board, using the board as "living" slides, so to speak. I could draw up models and critic them, I can write out key bullets point and add to them during the talk, I could pretty much do anything.</p>

<p>So there it was, I had created Whiteboard Testing.</p>
