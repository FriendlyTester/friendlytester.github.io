See if you can eloborate on the analogy of the train station.<br /><br />Where by people are walking with you and also against you.<br />Some pass by, some you bump into, some you have a little dance off with.<br /><br />Some working with you, will try and get in front of you, some will nudge you, trip you up.<br />Some will be moving faster than you.<br />Some will have baggage with them<br /><br />But remember yout goal, remember what you are working towards, where you want to be going, you will get there.<br /><br />In this instance its out of the station, but see where you can use this analogy yourself.<br /><br />
