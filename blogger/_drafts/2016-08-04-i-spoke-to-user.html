Hopefully you're over the shock now, but I did indeed talk to a user. Utter madness. Or not. Absolutely not, something that needs to be done more.<br /><br />So here's what happened. We released a new version of the APIs along with a new version of our iOS and Android app, as we try to do every month. All was well, downloads started, little to no errors reported in Google Analytics or Hockey App, seemed to be a job well done.<br /><br />Then over the course of the weekend, we started getting complaints from Window Phone users, that they were unable to use the app for it's intended purpose. Now to add to the story, we no longer actively work on the Windows Phone app, a business decision was made to no longer develop it, but it was agreed that the API would continue to fulfil its contract with that last version of the Window Phone application.<br /><br />So as soon as the complaints started to come up, it was obvious to me that the cause of these issues had to lay with the API changes, but from the stories there was nothing obvious that could be the cause. So I sourced a windows phone and download the application and logged in with one of my live test accounts, and nothing, nothing was wrong, the app was fully functional.
