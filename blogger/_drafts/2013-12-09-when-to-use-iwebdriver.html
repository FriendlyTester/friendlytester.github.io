I tend to use IWebDriver for most of my PO's this is because the CORE functionality of WebDriver will always be available on supported drivers.<br /><br />This will stop you use methods specific to a customer browser such as RemoteWebDriver or Chrome/Firefox etc.<br /><br />However if you do have something specific to a browser you can still use this in your PO by casting the IWebDriver instance to the required driver, allowing you to use those methods.<br /><br />But if you write all your POs against a certain driver you may run into issues when trying to use other drivers, or that specific driver changes its naming conventioned or approach
