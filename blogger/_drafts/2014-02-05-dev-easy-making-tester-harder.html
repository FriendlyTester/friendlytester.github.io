Is Testing becoming harder and development easier?<br /><br />Has development turned in a giant jigsaw? Its a difficult jigsaw don't get me wrong but still a jigsaw.<br /><br />there are so many libraries to choose from its simply plug and play?<br /><br />But from a testing perspective, all these libraries will have bugs, but do we ever test the&nbsp;libraries&nbsp;or just SUT interaction with such libraries?<br /><br />Take a look at market rate for dev and test and importantly the dev test space.
