Idea.<br /><br />A system where testers can submit questions to, and rate them as Entry, Medium and Expert.<br /><br />These questions are then stored and tester can then request a "random" question, which is then emailed to them.<br />Then email their answers, which are then published to the site.<br /><br />Don't duplicate questions, so some fuzzy match logic.<br /><br />Answers can be rated, commented on???
