A gripe about CV's.<br /><br />I did this 8 years ago, so obviously I still know this.<br /><br />Why so skill focused.<br /><br />Why not just a description of what roles are, and that you can learn lots of tools <br /><br />Why not an interactive session with recruiter, make them work, get them to ask appropiaate questions, send the transcripts over.<br /><br />Just all seems a bit dated
