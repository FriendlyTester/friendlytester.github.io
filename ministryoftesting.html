<p>I'm the FriendlyBoss over at the <a class="bluenumber" href="https://ministryoftesting.com">Ministry of Testing</a>. The Ministry of Testing is a professional learning network. We've created a safe, inclusive, diverse and exciting community about all things testing.</p>

<p>Ministry of Testing has too many initatives for me to list here, we're always starting new and innovative activitys to help us meet our motto, co-creating smarter testers.</p>
<p>My main focus at the Ministry of Testing is kind of an evangelist, trying to make more and more people aware of the fantastic work I believe Ministry of Testing is doing for the craft of software testing</p>
<p>Along side that, I'm very much involved with the organising and running of our conferences called <a class="bluenumber" href="https://ministryoftesting.com/events">TestBash</a>. We currently have a TestBash conference in 5 countries and more being planned.</p>
<p>We then have <a class="bluenumber" href="https://ministryoftesting.com">The Dojo</a>. The Dojo is an e-learning platform dedicated to software testing, and it's role within software development. We currently have 130+ conference talks on there, 50+ articles, many online courses and whole host of new material being worked on.</p>
<p>If you're interested in software testing and quality, I strongly encourage you to check out Ministry of Testing and subscribe to it's newsletter. You may feel I'm biased, but I was invovled with Ministry of Testing for over four years before working with them.</p>
<p>Ministry of Testing also have a <a class="bluenumber" href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/handbook/meetups/">20+ meetups</a> all over the world, so they're may be one near you. A great opportunity to meet testers and in your city.
<p>I encourage you to check it out. We also have a vast network of meetups around the world and host numerous conferences on both sides of the pond, all our events are here.</p>
