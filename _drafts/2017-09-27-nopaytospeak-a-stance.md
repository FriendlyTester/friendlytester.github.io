TL;DR: Conferences need to support their speakers. If it's a commercial conference, as a minimum it has to cover all speakers travel and accommodation to get my support.

Back in July I tweeted this. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonâ€™t talk at a conference unless ALL the speakers have their travel &amp; accommodation covered. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PayToSpeak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PayToSpeak</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpeakerConfessions?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpeakerConfessions</a></p>&mdash; Richard Bradshaw (@FriendlyTester) <a href="https://twitter.com/FriendlyTester/status/890543166994214912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

This topic has been grinding my gears for a while now, so I'm going to elaborate on it.

I'm a [seasoned speaker](/events/), I've spoken at nearly all major testing conferences, I've even do a few keynotes and in the past I've paid to speak. If conference speaking is new to you, when I say 'pay to speak' it means it personally costs me or my company money to talk at a conference. Majority of people tend to focus on travel and accommodation when they talk about paying to speak. But as we'll discuss later, paying to speak is far more than that.
